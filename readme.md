## SOOPA (Simple OOP Authentication)

SOOPA is a simple authentication system with Login and Register events. The classes can work seperately from this package. So you can use each of the classes with or without the complete SOOPA package.

> **Note** This repository is under development and still not completed. Thus it won't work :).

Completed Classes list:
- DB class
- Config class
- Validation class
- Input class
